The Movie Database Example
===========================================================

Introduction
-------------
- This is a sample application that build with combine use Clean Architecture framework and Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for request and showing the information
- This is an update from v1 sample with using Hilt and Coroutines replace for Dagger v2 and RxJava.

User interface
-------------
The UI will have two parts: Home screen and Movie detail screen as images below.

### Home screen

### Movie detail screen

* Use Android Framework from 3.5.x or greater for compile and run.

Framework
-------------
This example use Clean Architecture approach for build project.

-------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.

  * [Animations & Transitions][31] - Move widgets and transition between screens.
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
* Third party
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
  * [Hilt][93] for dependencies injection
  * [Retrofit][94] Type-safe HTTP client for Android
  * [EasyPermission][95]  is a wrapper library to simplify basic system permissions logic when targeting Android M or higher.
